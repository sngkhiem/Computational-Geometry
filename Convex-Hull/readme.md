# Convex Hull

## I. Definition
A subset $S$ of the plane is called *convex* if and only if for any pair of points $p, q \in S$ the line segment $\overline{pq}$ is completely contained in $S$. The *convex hull* $\mathcal{CH}(S)$ of a set $S$ is the smallest convex set that contains $S$. To be more precise, it is the intersection of all convex sets that contain $S$.
